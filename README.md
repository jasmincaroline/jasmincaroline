# Hi! I'm Jasmin! ðŸ‘‹


I'm an aspiring **Frontend Developer**, bringing the passion and analytical precision from my background in Letters and Linguistics into the world of software development. 

---

## ðŸ’¡ My Career Evolution in Code

My journey can be summarized in a small change of variables and comments, but with a significant shift in perspective:

// Before: Where is the subject of the sentence?

// Now: Why is this button 2 pixels to the right?

let career = 'Linguist';

career = "Frontend Developer";

## ðŸ“¬ Connect With Me

I enjoy discussing accessibility, interface design, and, of course, linguistics! Feel free to reach out.
